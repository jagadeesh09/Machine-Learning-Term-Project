# Machine-Learning-Term-Project
This is part of my course curriculum EE657 (Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning)

# Description
Four algorithms are implemented in this project
1) Bayesian classifier for classifying digits.
2) Gaussian mixture models for image segmentation
3) Principal Component Analysis for face recognition
4) Support Vector Machines
